# Pop-Shop Demo (server)

This project is the server side of a demo, full-stack Typescript/NodeJS e-commerce web app.

The server is hosted at:
https://pop-shop-server.herokuapp.com

The client is hosted at:
https://pop-shop.netlify.app

Although arbitrary, the products are an assortment of popular soft drinks from around the world, as well as branded t-shirts.  Placeholder text and images were used where, if this were a live application, professionally written copy and product images would be.
